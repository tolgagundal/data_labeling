# Manual Sentiment Labeling of Turkish Customer Reviews

## Project Description

I worked on this mini project, it simulates a simple data labeling task using a dataset of Turkish customer reviews.
My goal is to manually annotate text data with sentiment labels like "positive", "negative" and "neutral". 

## Dataset

This dataset consists of 15 Turkish customer reviews. I manually labeled as:

positive: clearly satisfied \
negative: complaints or dissatisfaction \
neutral: mixed or unclear tone

| review                              | label    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- |
| The delivery was fast, thanks       | positive |
| Package came so late, I dislike     | negative |
| Not bad...                          | neutral  |

## Tools I Used

Google Colab
Python (pandas)
Manual labeling (no automation)
