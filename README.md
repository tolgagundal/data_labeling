Manual Sentiment Labeling of Turkish Customer Reviews (Beginner Practice)

Project Description

This mini project simulates a simple data labeling task using a small set of Turkish customer reviews.
My goal is to manually annotate text data with sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral) and understand the core logic behind labeling workflows in real machine learning projects.

Dataset

The dataset consists of 15 Turkish customer reviews, manually labeled by me as:

positive: clearly satisfied feedback
negative: complaints, dissatisfaction
neutral: mixed or unclear tone

| review                              | label    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- |
| The delivery was fast, thanks       | positive |
| Package came so late, I dislike     | negative |
| Not bad...                          | neutral  |

Tools Used

Google Colab
Python (pandas)
Manual labeling (no automation)
